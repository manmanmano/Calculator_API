    //  The course is coming to an end and I would like you to tell me how did it go
    //  I really liked the course. The lectures were easy to follow and also fun to watch. This course has been my first
    //  approach to OOP so I am glad I took it. I found it really hard in the beginning, but with some extra work
    //  I managed to keep up and understand everything. I love streams... they are over powered.

    //todo A
    // On the scale 1 to 10 how useless or useful this course was with 1 being very useless and 10 being very useful?
    // 10
    // I learned Java so one of the most used languages, got into OOP, learned git, APIs, and SpringBoot.

    //todo B
    // Write some things you liked? At least 1, but you can write more.
    // I liked pretty much everything. I really enjoyed making the projects and also doing the exercises. STREAMS 100%
    //

    //todo C
    // Write some things you didn't like? At least 1, but you can write more.
    // In the beginning it was a bit hard to catch up since I didn't have any experience with OOP.
    //

    //todo D
    // Anything else to add? Comments? What to do differently next year? (optional)
    // Everything was good.
