    // todo this is contribution question
    //  this assignment is only for one team member (if this code is not committed by that team member how do I know this code was theirs?)

    // todo
    //  The course is coming to an end and I would like you to tell me how did it go

    //todo A
    // On the scale 1 to 10 how useless or useful this course was with 1 being very useless and 10 being very useful?
    // 10. Because this course is the first time I'm touching Java and I now know it to some level.

    //todo B
    // Write some things you liked? At least 1, but you can write more.
    // I liked the commentary on lesson videos, kinda felt like watching a YouTube video.
    // I liked that there were team projects not homeworks after each lesson.

    //todo C
    // Write some things you didn't like? At least 1, but you can write more.
    // Distance learning sometimes makes me lazier so I might not pay that much attention to the video, so maybe
    // adding small homeworks would change that. Although I mentioned that I liked there were no homeworks.

    //todo D
    // Anything else to add? Comments? What to do differently next year? (optional)
    // I liked this course and I can't really think of something to change in the format (distance learning) we had it.
